# Access the uploaded app

By accessing the app you can test the app experience. You can access the uploaded tab, bot, messaging extension, and connectors, after the app package is uploaded successfully.

## Access your uploaded configurable tab

If the app contains tabs, users can pin them to any conversation or team channel using the standard tab gallery flow:

1. Go to a channel in the team. Select **+** and **Add a tab** to the right of the existing tabs.

2. Select your tab from the gallery that appears.

3. Accept the consent prompt.

4. Configure your tab through the [configuration page](../../tabs/how-to/create-tab-pages/configuration-page.md) and select **Save**.

  ![The Add a tab dialog box](../../assets/images/tab_gallery.png) features a gallery of available tabs.

## Access your uploaded bot

When you add a bot to a team, it must be usable by anyone on that team, inside and outside the team channels, depending on bot scope definition. You and other team members can see a post in the **General** channel indicating that the bot has been added to the team.

For a Microsoft Teams bot, you can start the conversation by invoking your bot. You must @mention the name of the bot which must autocomplete.

To test direct chats with your bot, you can either access it through the App home, @mention it in a channel, or search for it in the **New Chat** window.

To add your bot to a conversation, you can @mention the bot name in a conversation or search for it in the **New Chat** window.

## Access your uploaded Connector

With the app loaded in the team or conversation, users can set up a Connector using the standard Connectors gallery flow:

1. Go to a channel in the team. Select **More options** (*&#8943;*) and choose **Connectors**.

2. Select your Connector from the sideloaded section at the bottom.

3. Configure your Connector through its [configuration page](../../webhooks-and-connectors/how-to/connectors-creating.md) and select **Save**.

  ![The Add a tab dialog box](../../assets/images/connector_gallery.png) features a gallery of available tabs.

## Access your uploaded messaging extension

An uploaded app with a messaging extension automatically appears in the **More options** (*&#8943;*) menu in the compose box.
