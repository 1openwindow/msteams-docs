# Submit your app to AppSource

## Teams app submission

Make your app available in the Microsoft Teams app catalog and on the web by publishing it to [AppSource](https://appsource.microsoft.com). At a high level, the process for submitting your app to AppSource is as follows:

1. Develop your app by following the [design guidelines](~/concepts/design/understand-use-cases.md). Tabs must follow the tab design guidelines for both, [desktop and web](~/tabs/design/tabs.md) and [mobile](~/tabs/design/tabs-mobile.md). Bots must follow the [bot design guidelines](~/bots/design/bots.md).
1. Ensure your app meets the app [validation policies](/legal/marketplace/certification-policies) for Microsoft Teams. 
1. Test your app with the [Manifest validation tool](prepare/submission-checklist.md#teams-app-validation-tool).
1. Set up a [developer account](/office/dev/store/open-a-developer-account) in [Partner Center](https://support.microsoft.com/help/4499930/partner-center-overview). *See also* [How do I create a Partner Center account](#how-do-i-create-a-partner-center-account) in the FAQ section.
1. Prepare your app for submission by following the [submission checklist](prepare/submission-checklist.md).
1. Review the [most failed test cases for a quicker app quality approval](prepare/frequently-failed-cases.md).
1. Submit your package to [AppSource through Partner Center](/office/dev/store/use-partner-center-to-submit-to-appsource).
1. Track the approval process on your Partner Center dashboard. *See* [Partner Center Overview](https://support.microsoft.com/help/4499930/partner-center-overview).
1. After submission, review the guidance for [Maintaining and supporting your published app](post-publish/overview.md).

>[!NOTE]
>
>- Your Teams app must be mobile-responsive and comply with [no upsell requirements](~/concepts/deploy-and-publish/appsource/prepare/frequently-failed-cases.md#-mobile-responsiveness-no-direct-upsell-or-payment) on mobile OS (iOS and Android). 
>- If your Teams app contains a bot, you must comply with the Bot Developer Framework [Code of Conduct](https://aka.ms/bf-conduct).
>- If your app contains an Office 365 Connector, additional terms may apply. See [Connectors Developer Dashboard](https://aka.ms/connectorsdashboard) and [App Developer Agreement](https://sellerdashboard.microsoft.com/Assets/Content/Agreements/Office_Store_Seller_Agreement_20120927.htm).
>- To make your app available for Government Community Cloud (GCC) users and to avoid duplicate app listings in the store, the auth process or flow must identify and route the user to the specified or expected content URL for GCC users.

## Why do I receive the message, "This account is not publish eligible," when I try to submit my add-in through Partner Center?

You receive the above error message when your [account verification status](/partner-center/verification-responses) is pending.

## What is verified in the Partner Center account verification process and how to respond?
There are three verification areas, **Email Ownership**, **Employment**, and **Business**. For more information on the verification process, see [What is verified and how to respond](/partner-center/verification-responses#what-is-verified-and-how-to-respond).
If you are the primary contact, Global admin, or Account admin, go to your Partner Profile to monitor verification status and track the progress.

After the verification process is complete, the verification status of your enrollment on the profile page changes from *pending* to *authorized*. After authorization, the process steps and their status are no longer available on the page. The primary contact receives an email from Microsoft within a few business days after the verification is complete.

## My account Verification status has not advanced beyond Email Ownership in the Partner Center. How should I proceed?

During the **Email Ownership** verification process, a verification email is sent to the primary contact email address. Check your primary contact inbox for an email from **maccount@<span>microsoft</span>.com** with the subject line *Action needed: Verify your email account with Microsoft*. Complete the email verification process. The verification email is sent to the email address listed on your account settings page in Partner Center.

> [!NOTE]
> * The email verification link is only valid for seven days. 
> * You can request us to resend the email by visiting your partner profile page and selecting the **Resend verification email** link.
> * To ensure that email is received, safe list the email from microsoft.com as a secure domain, and check your junk email folders.

Try the following:
* Check your junk or spam folder.
* Clear the browser cache, go to your Partner Center account dashboard, and select the **Resend verification email** link to have the verification email resent to your email address.
* Try accessing the **Resend verification email** link from a different browser.
