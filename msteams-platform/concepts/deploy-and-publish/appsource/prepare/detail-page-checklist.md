# Build a great app details page

The details page presents the first impression of your app to users. Each element of your details page can be used to convey your vision and drive downloads — consider how you want to showcase your app in a limited space. Here are some tips and tricks to help you engage your users before they even install your app.

> [!NOTE]
> Make sure your app information follows our [AppSource guidance for creating an effective store listing](/office/dev/store/create-effective-office-store-listings).

## App name

> [!div class="checklist"]
>
> * An app's name plays a critical role in how users discover it in the AppSource app store. Your app's short name is displayed on the details page.
>* The app name should reflect your app without any reference to Microsoft or Microsoft products.
>

> **Note**: If your app is an official partnership with Microsoft, then the name of the third-party app needs to be first, e.g., *Salesforce Connector for Microsoft Teams*.

> [!div class="checklist"]
>
>* Use these resources for guidance:

* [App name guide](#app-name)
* [Microsoft Trademark and Brand Guidelines](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/legal/intellectualproperty/trademarks/usage/general)

**Do's:**

* Choose a simple, memorable name that hints at what your app does.
* Be distinctive.
* If needed, use Microsoft 365 references instead of Office 365.

**Don'ts:**

* Don't omit spaces, have an incorrect case, or contain language errors in the app name.
* Don't use generic terms or names similar to existing apps.
* Don't use "Teams", "Microsoft", existing/upcoming Microsoft product names, or  "app" in your app name.
* Don't use parenthesis to include Microsoft products, e.g., *Your-App-Name (for Microsoft Teams)*.

## Color icon

This is one of the first elements that users see. It should be attractive and eye-catching when scrolling through the app store. Be sure it makes a good first impression and also communicates your brand's image and purpose. AppSource has more tips on [creating a consistent visual identity](/office/dev/store/create-effective-office-store-listings#create-a-consistent-visual-identity).

**Don'ts:**

* Your icon must not mimic any copyrighted products that you don't own.
* Your icon must not look similar to any Microsoft product/brands.

## Outline icon

This icon is used for pinned messaging extensions and when your app displays on the left of Teams. See [design guidance for the outline icon](../../../../concepts/build-and-test/apps-package.md#outline-icon).

**Don'ts:**

* Your icon must not mimic any copyrighted products you don't own.
* Your icon must not look similar to any Microsoft product/brands.

## Short description

This is a concise summary of your app. You want it to be original, engaging, and directed at your target audience. Ideally, try and describe your solution and its value to your users in one sentence.

**Do's:**

* Put the most important information first.
* Include keywords that customers are likely to search for.
* If you need to mention Microsoft Teams, the first mention of Microsoft Teams should be written out in full as *Microsoft Teams*. If Teams is mentioned again in the same description, the name can be shortened to *Teams*.
* Any references to Microsoft or Microsoft Teams can be part of the description and should follow Microsoft’s brand standards and guidelines.
* All descriptions must be grammatically correct with no language errors.
* Avoid unnecessary use of capitalizations, e.g., stating "Users" instead of "users".

**Don'ts:**

* Don't repeat the title.
* Don't abbreviate Microsoft to "MS" or "MSFT".
* Don't use jargon or specialized terminology — you can't assume that users know what to look for.
* Avoid unnecessary reference to Microsoft product names unless absolutely necessary.
* Don't indicate or imply that the app is an offering from Microsoft.
* Don't use copyrighted brand names you don't own.
* Don't  use "for Teams" in a short name.

## Long description

> [!div class="checklist"]
>
>* This provides an engaging narrative highlighting your solution's main features, the problems it solves, and the target audience. Draw in your audience with the first sentence by communicating your app's unique features. Your description must be under 4000 characters; most users will only read between 300 and 500 words.
>* What is allowed?

* `<your_app>`  "works with Microsoft Teams"
* `<for users>`  "working with Microsoft Teams"
* `<for tasks>`  "within Microsoft Teams"
* `<an app>`  "for Microsoft Teams"
* `<your_app>`  "integrates with Microsoft Teams"
* "...integrated with Microsoft Teams"
* "...built on…"
* "...runs on…"
* "…enabled by…"
* "…developed for…"
* "…designed for…"

> **Note**: The above terms also apply to the use of Microsoft 365. Office 365 is now called Microsoft 365. Please update your app descriptions to reflect this.

>[!IMPORTANT]
> Make sure to precisely copy the descriptions you wrote in your AppSource entry to your app manifest — the values must match. Microsoft Teams will only use the descriptions you provide in the app manifest.

**Do's:**

* Use [Markdown formatting](https://support.office.com/article/use-markdown-formatting-in-teams-4d10bd65-55e2-4b2d-a1f3-2bebdcd2c772) to illuminate your description.  
* List features to aid readers in scanning your description.
* Use active voice and speak to users directly.
* Use bullet points to list out your features.
* Include a help or support link so your users know how to reach you if they have questions.
* Make certain that the first mention of Microsoft Teams is written out in full as "*Microsoft Teams*". If Teams is mentioned again later in the same description, the name can be shortened to "*Teams*".
* Any references to Microsoft or Microsoft Teams (only if necessary)  may be part of the long description and should follow Microsoft’s brand standards and guidelines.
* All descriptions must be grammatically correct with no language errors.
* Avoid unnecessary use of capitalizations for terms in your description (example: stating "Users" instead of "users".
* Avoid acronyms.
* Make sure to call out limitations, account dependency, configuration set up, future updates in releases, or any usage constraints

|Escape|`\*Payroll tools that help you manage your payroll and tax documents.` |\*Payroll tools that help you manage your payroll and tax documents.

* Avoid unnecessary reference to Microsoft product names unless absolutely necessary.
* Don't indicate that the app is an offering from Microsoft.

* Don't use the following language unless the app has gone through an official certification process:

  * "…certified for…"
  * "…powered by…"

* Don't abbreviate “Microsoft” to “MS” or “MSFT” — write Microsoft out in full.
* No part of description or metadata can indicate the app as an official Microsoft offering.
* Partners may not use or imitate any Microsoft tagline, or use the name of any Microsoft product or service in the slogan or tagline.
* Logo must not wrongly depict the app as an official Microsoft product/ feature or mimic any of the existing or upcoming Microsoft products.

## Screenshots

The screenshots uploaded on the [Partner Center](https://partner.microsoft.com) are displayed in both [AppSource](https://appsource.microsoft.com/marketplace/apps?product=office%3Bteams&page=1) and your app listing in the Teams client. They provide a visual preview of your app along with your app description.
You can provide one to five screenshots formatted as .png, .jpg, or .gif files. Screenshots should be 1366 x 768 pixels with a maximum size of 1024 KB.

**Do's:**

* Focus on highlighting all your app's capabilities.
* Content should accurately represent your app.
* Text should be well-populated without being excessive.
* You can surround your screenshots with a background color and add marketing content similar to the [Freshdesk](https://appsource.microsoft.com/product/office/WA104381505?src=office&tab=Overview) example; however, the dimensions won't be of the screenshot alone but will include the overall image.

<img width="800px" alt="Freshdesk screenshot" src="../../../../assets/images/freshdesk.png" />

**Don'ts:**

* Don't show specific devices, like phones or laptops.
* Don't show any chrome/UI from outside of your app.
* Don't capture any Teams or browser UI in your screenshots.
* Don't include mock-ups that inaccurately reflect your apps actual UI such as showing your website instead of your Teams tab.

## Videos

If an image is worth a thousand words, then a video is worth a thousand images. Videos are the most effective way to communicate the benefits of using your app. It will be placed in front of all your screenshots on the app details page. Make sure you mention the following:

* How your app works.
* What can be achieved with your app.
* The benefits of using your app.
* Who your is for.

Remember to keep your presentation short and sweet — somewhere between 30-90 seconds.
