# Access the uploaded app

You can access the uploaded tab, bot, messaging extension, and connectors, after the app package is uploaded successfully using Teams Store.

## Access your uploaded configurable tab

If the app contains tabs, users can pin them to any conversation or team channel using the standard tab gallery flow:

1. Go to a channel in the team. Select **+** and **Add a tab** to the right of the existing tabs.

2. Select your tab from the gallery that appears.

3. Accept the consent prompt.

4. Configure your tab through the [configuration page](../../tabs/how-to/create-tab-pages/configuration-page.md) and select **Save**.

## Access your uploaded bot

When you add a bot to a team, it must be usable by anyone on that team, inside and outside the team channels, depending on bot scope definition. You and other team members can see a post in the **General** channel indicating that the bot has been added to the team.

For a teams-enabled bot, you can start by invoking your bot by @mentioning the name of the bot, which must autocomplete.

To test direct chats with your bot, you can either access it through the App home, @mention it in a channel, or search for it in the **New Chat** window.

When you add your bot to a conversation to test direct chats with your bot, you can @mention the bot name in a conversation, or search for it in the **New Chat** window.

## Access your uploaded Connector

With the app loaded in the team or conversation, users can set up a Connector using the standard Connectors gallery flow:

1. Go to a channel in the team. Select **More options** (*&#8943;*) and choose **Connectors**.

2. Select your Connector from the **Sideloaded** section at the bottom.

3. Configure your Connector through its [configuration page](../../webhooks-and-connectors/how-to/connectors-creating.md) and select **Save**.

An uploaded app with a messaging extension automatically appears in the **More options** (*&#8943;*) menu in the compose box.
