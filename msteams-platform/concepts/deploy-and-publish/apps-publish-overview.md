# Publish your apps
This document provides an overview of the steps you must take to publish your app successfully to an App Store or AppSource, formerly Office Store.

Apps that you develop need to be published to your organization for the users to use them. There is a complete process to publish your apps that includes, distribution of apps, packaging and uploading of apps, and finally publishing of apps.

## Distribute your apps
You can distribute your apps to an Enterprise organization, for example, a corporate or US Government organizations, such as federal, state, territorial, and tribal bodies. There are three methods to distribute your app. When distributing the apps, you must ensure that you adhere to the compliance policies of the selected organization. For more information, see [distribute your app](overview.md).

## Create your app package
After selecting the method to distribute your app, you need to create an app package. An app package helps you upload all core components of your app to the App Store or AppSource at one go. For more information, see [create your app package](../build-and-test/apps-package.md).

## Upload your app package
You can upload your app package to a team or a conversation through the App Store. You can also upload it using the AppSource. For more information, see [upload your app](apps-upload.md).

## Access the components of your app package 
After uploading your app package, access it and test the components before publishing to your organization. For more information, see [access your app package components](apps-access.md).

 ## Publish your app to your organization
The final step is to publish your app to your organization, such that the users can start using your app. For more information, see [publish your app](https://docs.microsoft.com/MicrosoftTeams/manage-apps?toc=%2Fmicrosoftteams%2Fplatform%2Ftoc.json&bc=%2FMicrosoftTeams%2Fbreadcrumb%2Ftoc.json).
