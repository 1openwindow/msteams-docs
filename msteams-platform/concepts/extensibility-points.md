# Entry points for Teams apps

Microsoft Teams provides a flexible set of entry points where people can discover and use your app. Your app can be as simple as embedding existing web content in a tab or a multi-faceted app that users interact with across several contexts.

The most successful apps feel native to Teams, so it's important to carefully plan your app's entry points.

## Teams, channels, and chats

Teams, channels, and chats are collaboration spaces. Apps in these contexts are available to everyone in that space and typically focus on additional workflows or unlocking new social interactions.

Here's how Teams app capabilities are commonly used in collaborative contexts:

* [**Tabs**](~/tabs/what-are-tabs.md) provide a full-screen embedded web experience configured for the team, channel, or group chat. All members interact with the same web-based content, so a stateless single page app experience is typical.

* [**Messaging extensions**](~/messaging-extensions/what-are-messaging-extensions.md) are shortcuts for inserting external content into a conversation or taking action on messages without leaving Teams. Link unfurling provides rich content when sharing content from a common URL.

* [**Bots**](~/bots/what-are-bots.md) interact with members of the conversation through chat and responding to events (like adding a new member or renaming a channel). Conversations with a bot in these contexts are visible to all members of the team, channel, or group, so bot conversations should be relevant to everyone.

* [**Webhooks and connectors**](~/webhooks-and-connectors/what-are-webhooks-and-connectors.md) allow an external service to post messages into a conversation and users to send messages to a service.

## Personal apps

[Personal apps](~/concepts/design/personal-apps.md) focus on interactions with a single user. The experience in this context is unique to each user.

Here's how Teams capabilities are commonly used in personal contexts:

* [**Bots**](~/bots/what-are-bots.md) have one-on-one conversations with a user. Bots that require multi-turn conversations or provide notifications relevant only to a specific user are best suited in personal apps.

* [**Tabs**](~/tabs/what-are-tabs.md) provide a full-screen embedded web experience with a personalized view for each user.
