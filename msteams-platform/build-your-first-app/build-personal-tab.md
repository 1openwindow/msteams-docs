# Build a basic personal tab for Microsoft Teams

This tutorial teaches you to build a basic personal tab in Microsoft Teams. Tabs are a simple way to surface information in your app by hosting web content in Teams. Tabs are a common feature of personal apps that provide a private workspace for individual users. Personal tabs are the closest thing to a traditional web experience in Teams. 

## What you'll learn

* Understand the app configurations and scaffolding relevant to personal tabs.
* Create a tab content with a contact list of your organization.
* Update a tab's color theme based on user preference.

## Prerequisites

Make sure that you understand how to set up and build a simple Teams app. For more information, see [create your first Microsoft Teams "Hello, World!" app](../build-your-first-app/build-and-run.md).

## 1. Understand your app project components

After you have created a basic personal tab, the generated app scaffold provides the components for rendering your personal tab in Teams. There's a lot you can work with, but for now let us focus on the following: 

* `Tab.js` file in the `src/components` directory of your project. This is for rendering your tab content page.
* Microsoft Teams JavaScript client SDK, which is pre-loaded in your project's front-end components.

As you may notice from the `import` section at the top of `Tabs.js` file, the sample code uses [React](https://reactjs.org/), an open-source JavaScript library for building user-interface. 

> [!NOTE]
> Although using React is _not_ required for Teams development, this tutorial teaches you with React.

## 2. Customize your tab content page

You can customize your tab content page to render a list of important contacts in your organization. 

**To customize your tab content page**

1. Copy and modify the following code sample with information that's relevant to you. You can also use the code as is: 
    ```JSX
    <div>
      <h1>Important Contacts</h1>
        <ul>
          <li>Help Desk: <a href="mailto:support@company.com">support@company.com</a></li>
          <li>Human Resources: <a href="mailto:hr@company.com">hr@company.com</a></li>
          <li>Facilities: <a href="mailto:facilities@company.com">facilities@company.com</a></li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    ```
1. Got to the `src/components` directory and open the `Tab.js` file. 
1. Go to `render()` and replace the template code with the modified code inside `return()` as shown in the following example:
    ```JavaScript
    render() {
      return (
        <div>
          <h1>Important Contacts</h1>
            <ul>
              <li>Help Desk: <a href="mailto:support@company.com">support@company.com</a></li>
              <li>Human Resources: <a href="mailto:hr@company.com">hr@company.com</a></li>
              <li>Facilities: <a href="mailto:facilities@company.com">facilities@company.com</a></li>
            </ul>
        </div>
      );
    }
    ```
1. Go to the `src/components` directory and modify the `App.css` file with the following code to make the email links easier to read with any theme that is used:
    ```CSS
    a {
      color: inherit;
    }
    ```
1. Save your changes. 

   You can view the new content in your app's tab in Teams.

## 3. Update your tab theme

It is important for your tab to have a theme that feels native to Teams. You must blend your tab with the Teams theme. Your users generally prefer default (light), dark, or high contrast themes. As you might have noticed in the last screenshot, your tab still has a light background when your user is using the dark theme. This is not a recommended user experience.

The Teams JavaScript client SDK can make your app aware of and react to theme changes in the client. To do this, follow these steps:

1. **Get context about the configured Teams client theme**
  The `microsoftTeams.getContext()` call in your `Tab.js` file, provides some context about the configured client theme (such as dark theme). The following code accesses the `context` interface and its properties:

    ```JavaScript
    componentDidMount(){
      // Get the user context from Teams and set it in the state
      microsoftTeams.getContext((context, error) => {
        this.setState({
          context: context,
          theme: context.theme
        });
      });
    }
    ```
1. **Create a theme change handler**
   With the `context` properties in hand, your app has a solid understanding of what's happening around it in Teams. However, the app still doesn't have an appearance reflecting the theme when a user updates it.

   You need a handler to update your app's state with the theme. To create a handler, insert the following theme change handler immediately after the `microsoftTeams.getContext()` call:

    ```JavaScript
    microsoftTeams.registerOnThemeChangeHandler(theme => {
    if (theme !== this.state.context.theme) {
    this.setState({
      context: {
      ...this.state.context,
      theme
      }
      })   
      }
    });
      ```
1. **Match the theme styles**
   Your theme change handler is in place, however, you still have to respond to changes and align your tab's colors with the current theme.

   In the `render()` function, store the state provided by the theme change handler in `isTheme`:

    ```JavaScript
      const isTheme = this.state.context.theme
    ```
    
    > [!NOTE]
    > This example is just one way you might apply styles to your tab. Use the code as is, expand on it, or write your own.

    After storing the state provided by the theme change handler, provide the conditional logic to render your tab's styles based on the current theme. The following example shows a basic way to do this:

    1. Go to `render()` and check the current theme in `isTheme`.
    1. Create a `newTheme` object with CSS properties relevant to the current theme.
    1. Apply the following CSS to your tab content's root HTML element (`<div style={newTheme}>`):

        ```JavaScript
         let newTheme
          if (isTheme === "default") {
            newTheme = {
              backgroundColor: "#EEF1F5",
              color: "#16233A"
            };
          } else {
            newTheme = {
              backgroundColor: "#2B2B30",
              color: "#FFFFFF"
            };
          }
        ```

       Check your tab in Teams. The appearance now closely matches the dark theme.
