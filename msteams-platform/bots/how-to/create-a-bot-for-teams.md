# Create a bot for Microsoft Teams

## Writing notes

* **Purpose** This article should describe how to register your bot service, create your bot web app, and add a bot to the Team's app manifest. Focus should be on the options for registering your bot service. It should include:
  * Register your bot with App Studio
  * Register your bot in the Azure Portal
  * Create your bot's web app (both C# and Node)
* **Existing teams doc reference** [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/concepts/bots/bots-create](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/concepts/bots/bots-create)
* **Existing Bot framework doc reference** [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bot-service/dotnet/bot-builder-dotnet-sdk-quickstart?view=azure-bot-service-4.0](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bot-service/dotnet/bot-builder-dotnet-sdk-quickstart?view=azure-bot-service-4.0)
* **Code Snippets** none

This article may be extraneous, or could be moved to the conceptual level, and covered at the how-to level in quickstarts. What can't be missed is the ability to register your bot service w/o an Azure Subscription.
