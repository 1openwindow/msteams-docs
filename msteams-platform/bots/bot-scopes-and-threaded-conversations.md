# Bot scopes and threaded conversations

## Writing notes

 * **Purpose** This conceptual article is about describing how heirarchical conversations and the bot's scope defined in the app manifest differ from other channels with a bot. It should describe the relationship between teams, channels, conversation thread (replies vs creating new threads), and the different scopes available to your bot, what events are available in those scopes, the different data/events/actions available to your bot in those scopes.
 * **Existing teams doc reference** none
 * **Existing Bot framework doc reference** none
 * **Code Snippets** not applicable for conceptual articles
