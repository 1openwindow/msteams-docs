# Deploy your Teams apps to Azure

After you've built and tested your app in the local environment, it's time to deploy it to Azure. The Teams Toolkit helps you to provision and deploy your app.

Before deployment, the application has been running locally:

* The backend runs using **Azure Functions Core Tools**.
* The application HTTP endpoint, where Microsoft Teams loads the application, runs locally.

Deployment is a two-step process. You provision the resources on an active Azure subscription, and then deploy or upload the backend and frontend code for the application to Azure.

* The backend, if configured, uses various Azure services, including Azure App Service and Azure Storage.
* The frontend application will be deployed to an Azure Storage account configured for static web hosting.
