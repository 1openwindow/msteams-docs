<a name="GetPrerequisites"></a>

### Download and host your app

Follow these steps to download and host a "hello world" app in Teams.

<a name="GetPrerequisites"></a>

## Get prerequisites

To complete this tutorial, you need the following tools. If you don't already have them, you can install them from these links.

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [Node.js and NPM](https://nodejs.org/)
- Get any text editor or IDE. You can install and use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) for free.

If you see options to add `git`, `node`, `npm`, and `code` to the PATH during installation, select the options. 

Verify that the tools are available by running the following in a terminal window:

> [!NOTE]
> Use the terminal window that you are most comfortable with on your platform. These examples use Bash (which is included in Git), but these scripts will run on most platforms.

```bash
$ git --version
git version 2.19.0.windows.1

$ node -v
v8.9.3

$ npm -v
5.5.1

$ gulp -v
CLI version 2.3.0
Local version 4.0.2
```

You can use a different version of these applications without any problem. Only for gulp, you'll need to use version 4.0.0 or later.

If you don't have gulp installed (or have the wrong version installed), do so by running `npm install gulp` in the terminal window.

If you have installed Visual Studio Code, you can verify the installation by running:

```bash
code --version
1.28.2
929bacba01ef658b873545e26034d1a8067445e9
```

You can continue to use this terminal window to run the commands that follow in this tutorial.

## Download the sample

You can use the [Hello, World!](https://github.com/OfficeDev/Microsoft-Teams-Samples/tree/main/samples/app-hello-world/nodejs) sample to get started. In a terminal window, run the following command to clone the sample repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/OfficeDev/Microsoft-Teams-Samples.git
```

> [!TIP]
> You can [fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) this [repo](https://github.com/OfficeDev/Microsoft-Teams-Samples) if you want to modify and check in your changes to your GitHub repo for future reference.

<a name="BuildRun"></a>

## Build and run the sample

After the repository is cloned, run the change directory command in terminal to change the directory to the sample:

```bash
cd Microsoft-Teams-Samples/samples/app-hello-world/nodejs/
```

In build the sample, install all its dependencies using the following command:

```bash
npm install
```

You should see a bunch of dependencies getting installed. After installation you can run the app with the following command:

```bash
npm start
```

When the hello-world app starts, it displays `App started listening on port 3333` in the terminal window.

> [!NOTE]
> If you see a different port number displayed in the message above, it is because you have a PORT environment variable set. You can continue to use that port or
> change your environment variable to 3333.

At this point, you can open a browser window and navigate to the following URLs to verify that all the app URLs are loading:

- `http://localhost:3333`
- `http://localhost:3333/hello`
- `http://localhost:3333/first`
- `http://localhost:3333/second`

<a name="HostSample"></a>

## Deploy your sample app

Remember that apps in Microsoft Teams are web applications exposing one or more capabilities. Make your app available on the internet so that the Teams platform can load it. To make your app reachable from the internet, you need to *host* your app.

For local testing, you can run the app on your local machine and create a tunnel to it with a web endpoint. [ngrok](https://ngrok.com) is a free tool that lets you do just that. With *ngrok*, you can get a web address such as `https://d0ac14a5.ngrok.io` (this URL is just an example). You can [download and install](https://ngrok.com/download) *ngrok* for your environment. Make sure you add it to a location in your `PATH`.

After you install it, open a new terminal window. Run the following command to create a tunnel. The sample uses port 3333, so use that value:

```bash
ngrok http 3333 -host-header=localhost:3333
```

*Ngrok* will listen to requests from the internet and will route them to your app running on port 3333. You can verify by opening your browser and going to `https://d0ac14a5.ngrok.io/hello` to load your app's hello page. Ensure that you use the forwarding address displayed by *ngrok* in your console session instead of this URL.

> [!NOTE]
> If you used a different port during [build and run](#build-and-run-the-sample), make sure you use the same port number to setup the *ngrok* tunnel.
> [!TIP]
> It is a good idea to run *ngrok* in a different terminal window to keep it running without interfering with the node app which you might later have to stop, rebuild and rerun. The *ngrok* session will return useful debugging information in this window.

The paid version of *ngrok* allows persistent names. 
If you use the free version, your app will be available only during the current session on your development machine. It isn't available if the machine is shut down or goes to sleep. When you restart the service, it returns a new address. Then, you must update every location that uses the outdated address. Remember this step when sharing the app for testing.

Note of the URL of your app for registering the app with Teams. You can register the app using App studio or Developer Portal.

## Deploy your app to Microsoft Teams

After deploying your app on the internet, deploy it to Teams by creating an app package. This package contains the app manifest and app icons. The Teams uses these files to display and brand the app. You can create this package manually or use App Studio or Developer Portal that are recommended for creating it. These tools run in Teams and you can use them for registering your app with Teams.

To register your app with Teams, you need:

- The URL where your app can be found on the internet.
- Icons that Teams will use to brand your app. The sample comes with placeholder icons located in "src\static\images. App Studio also will provide default icons, if needed.

**Update the app package**

# [App Studio](#tab/AS)

[!include [Use App Studio to configure the app package](~/includes/get-started/get-started-use-app-studio.md)]

# [Developer Portal](#tab/DP)

**To install Developer Portal (preview) in Teams**

1. Select the **Apps** icon at the bottom of the left-hand bar, and search for **Developer Portal**.

    <img width="430px" alt="Screenshot of TDP" src="~/assets/images/Screen1.png"/>

1. Select **Developer Portal** and select **Open**.

    <img width="430px" alt="Screenshot of TDP Open" src="~/assets/images/screen2.png"/>

1. Select the Apps tab and select **Import an existing app**.

    <img width="430px" alt="Screenshot of import app in tdp" src="~/assets/images/screen3.png"/>

1. Select **Hello World** and select **Import**. The **Hello World** app is imported in Developer Portal. 

    You can configure your app using the Teams Developer Portal. The Manifest is found under Distribute. You can use the Manifest to configure capabilities, required resources, and other important attributes for your app. For more information about how to configure your app using Developer Portal, see [Teams Developer Portal](../concepts/build-and-test/teams-developer-portal.md).

## Update the credentials for your hosted app

The sample app requires the following environment variables to be set to the values you made a note of earlier:

```
MICROSOFT_APP_ID=<YOUR BOT'S APP ID>
MICROSOFT_APP_PASSWORD=<YOUR BOT'S PASSWORD>
WEBSITE_NODE_DEFAULT_VERSION=8.9.4
```

The environment variables are a part of your environment. Only your app's code can access them. They aren't exposed to any third parties.

If you're running the app using ngrok, you'll need to set up local environment variables. You can use Visual Studio Code to add a [launch configuration](https://code.visualstudio.com/Docs/editor/debugging#_launch-configurations):

``` 
{
    "type": "node",
    "request": "launch",
    "name": "Launch - Teams Debug",
    "program": "${workspaceRoot}/src/app.js",
    "cwd": "${workspaceFolder}/src",
    "env": {
        "BASE_URI": "https://yourNgrokURL.ngrok.io",
        "MICROSOFT_APP_ID": "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000",
        "MICROSOFT_APP_PASSWORD": "yourBotAppPassword",
        "NODE_DEBUG": "botbuilder",
        "SUPPRESS_NO_CONFIG_WARNING": "y",
        "NODE_CONFIG_DIR": "../config"
    }
}
```

Where:

- The authorization credentials for your bot are as follows:
  - MICROSOFT_APP_ID is ID
  - MICROSOFT_APP_PASSWORD is password
- NODE_DEBUG show you what's happening in your bot in the Visual Studio Code debug console
- NODE_CONFIG_DIR points to the directory at the root of the repository (by default, when the app is run locally, it looks for the root directory in the `src` folder).

> [!Note]
> If you have not stopped npm from earlier in the tutorial, you'll need to run `npm stop` in order for Visual Studio Code to pickup your launch configuration variables correctly.

## Configure the app tab

After you install the app into Teams, you need to configure it to show content. 
1. Go to a channel in Teams, and select the **'+'** button to add a new tab.
1. You can then choose `Hello World` from the **Add a tab** list.
1. In the configuration dialog, select the tab you want to display in the channel. Then, select **Save**. 

You can see the `Hello World` tab loaded with the tab you chose:

<img width="430px" alt="Screenshot of configure" src="~/assets/images/samples-hello-world-tab-configure.png"/>

### Test your bot in Teams

You can now interact with the bot in Teams. Choose a channel in the team where you registered your app, and type `@your-bot-name`, followed by your message. This type of message is called an **\@mention**. Whatever message you send to the bot will be sent back to you as a reply:

### Test your messaging extension

**To test your messaging extension**
1. Select the three dots below the input box in your conversation view. A menu with the **'Hello World'** app is displayed.
1. Select the menu. A set of random texts is displayed. You can select one of the random texts and that is inserted into your conversation.

    <img width="430px" alt="Messaging extension menu" src="~/assets/images/samples-hello-world-messaging-extensions-menu1.png" />

    <img width="430px" alt="Messaging extension result" src="~/assets/images/samples-hello-world-messaging-extensions-result1.png" />

1. Select one of the random texts. The formatted card appears ready to send with your own message included at the bottom:
