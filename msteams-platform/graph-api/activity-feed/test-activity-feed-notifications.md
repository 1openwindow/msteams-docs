# Test activity feed notification in Teams

The activity feed API is a Microsoft Teams and Microsoft Graph integration that enables your app to use API endpoints to send activity feed notifications to Teams users. Activity feed notifications can range from identifying tasks requiring a user's attention, to actions taken by others that affect the user or a set of users.

> [!NOTE]
>To test activity feed notifications:
> 1. Your Teams app manifest file must include **webApplicationInfo** and **activities** keys. *See*, [Update your Teams app manifest](feed-notifications.md#update-your-teams-app-manifest).
>2. The **Upload custom apps** policy setting must be enabled as part of the custom app setup policies. *See* [Custom app policy settings](/microsoftteams/teams-custom-app-policies-and-settings#custom-app-policy-and-settings). <br/>

1. `client_id`  — your app's Azure AD app id.
1. `client_secret`  — your Azure AD app secret (password)
1. `tenantId` — you can get the unique identifier tenant id from the Teams client as follows:

* In the Teams client, select **Teams** from the far left nav bar .
* Select the team where the app is installed from the dropdown menu.
* Select the **More options** icon (&#8943;).

>* [Upload your app package](../../concepts/deploy-and-publish/apps-upload.md#upload-your-package-into-a-team-using-the-apps-tab) directly to a specific team, one-to-one chat, or group chat.
> * Open the [Postman](https://www.postman.com) app:

* Select **File** -> **Import** -> **Upload Files** to upload the JSON file from your environment.  
* Select the **Collections** tab.
* Select the chevron (>) next to **Activity Feed** to expand the details view and see the API requests.
* Select the authentication request.
* Select an API.

 Check the response status codes to confirm that the activity feed notification behavior in your app meets expectations.
