# Define action-based messaging extension commands

Action-based messaging extensions commands allow you present your users with a modal popup to collect or display information, then process their interaction and send information back to Teams. They can be triggered from the compose message area, the command box, or from a message.

In addition to choosing where your command can be invoked from, you must also chose how to create the modal popup for your users. You have three options for creating the modal (which is rendered in a task module):

* **Static list of parameters** - The simplest option. Using your app manifest you can define a list of parameters (input fields) that Teams will render for you. You cannot control the formatting with this option.
* **Adaptive card** - You can choose to use an adaptive card, which provides greater control over the UI, but still limits you on the available controls and formatting options.
* **Embedded web view** - If you need complete control over the UI and controls, you can choose to embed a custom web view in the task module.
