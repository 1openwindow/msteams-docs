## Prerequisites

Before you create your personal tab, you must install a few tools and set up your development environment.

* An Office 365 tenant and a team configured with **Allow uploading custom apps** enabled. For more information, see [Prepare your Microsoft 365 tenant](~/concepts/build-and-test/prepare-your-o365-tenant.md).

    >[!NOTE]
    > If you don't have a Microsoft 365 account, sign up for a free subscription through the [Microsoft Developer Program](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/dev-program). The subscription will remain active as long as you are using it for ongoing development.

* An App Studio to import your application to Teams. To install an App Studio, select **Apps** ![Store App](~/assets/images/tab-images/storeApp.png) at the bottom-left corner of the Teams app, and search for App Studio. Select the tile and install in the pop-up window dialog box.

* The current version of Visual Studio IDE with the **.NETCore cross-platform development** workload installed. You can download and install the latest [Microsoft Visual Studio Community](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads) version for free.

* The [ngrok](https://ngrok.com) reverse proxy tool to create a tunnel to your locally running web server's publicly-available HTTPS endpoints. You can [download it here](https://ngrok.com/download).
