# What are Microsoft Teams tabs?

Tabs are Teams-aware webpages embedded in Microsoft Teams. They are simple HTML <iframe\> tags that point to domains declared in the app manifest and can be added as part of a channel inside a team, group chat, or personal app for an individual user. You can include custom tabs with your app to embed your own web content in Teams or add Teams-specific functionality to your web content. *See* [Teams JavaScript client SDK](/javascript/api/overview/msteams-client).

It's recommended that you set the intended use for your cookies rather than rely on default browser behavior. *See* [SameSite cookie attribute (2020 update)](../resources/samesite-cookie-update.md).

There are two types of tabs available in Teams â€” channel/group and personal. Channel/group tabs deliver content to channels and group chats, and are a great way to create collaborative spaces around dedicated web-based content. Personal tabs, along with personally-scoped bots, are part of personal apps and are scoped to a single user. They can be pinned to the left navigation bar for easy access.

## Lesser known tab features

> * If a tab is added to an app that also has a bot, the bot is added to the team as well.
> * Awareness of Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) ID of the current user.
> * Locale awareness for the user to indicate language, i.e., `en-us`. 
> * Single sign-on (SSO) capability, if supported.
> * Ability to use bots or app notifications to deep link to the tab or to a sub-entity within the service, e.g., an individual work item.
> * The ability to open a task module from links within a tab.
> * Reuse of SharePoint web parts within the tab.

## Tabs user scenarios

**Scenario:** Bring an existing web-based resource inside Teams. \
**Example:** You create a personal tab in your Teams app that presents an informational corporate website to users.

**Scenario:** Add support pages to a Teams bot or messaging extension. \
**Example:** You create personal tabs that provide *about* and *help* webpage content to users.

**Scenario:** Provide access to items that your users interact with regularly for cooperative dialogue and collaboration. \
**Example:** You create a channel/group tab with deep linking to individual items.

## How do tabs work?

A custom tab is declared in the app manifest of your app package. For each webpage you want included as a tab in your app, you define a URL and a scope. Additionally, you need to add the [Teams JavaScript client SDK](/javascript/api/overview/msteams-client) to your page, and call `microsoftTeams.initialize()` after your page loads. Doing so will tell Teams to display your page, give you access to Teams-specific information (for example if the Teams client is running the *dark theme*), and allow you to take action based on the results.

Whether you choose to expose your tab within the channel/group or personal scope, you'll need to present an <iframe\> HTML [content page](~/tabs/how-to/create-tab-pages/content-page.md) in your tab. For personal tabs, the content URL is set directly in your Teams app manifest by the `contentUrl` property in the `staticTabs` array. Your tab's content will be the same for all users.

For channel/group tabs, you also need to create an additional configuration page that allows users to configure your content page URL, typically by using URL query string parameters to load the appropriate content for that context. This is because your channel/group tab can be added to multiple different teams or group chats. On each subsequent install, your users will be able to configure the tab, allowing you to tailor the experience as needed. When users add or configure a tab, a URL is being associated with the tab that is presented in the Teams UI. Configuring a tab is simply adding additional parameters to that URL. For example, when you add the Azure Boards tab, the configuration page allows you to choose which board the tab will load. The configuration page URL is specified by the  `configurationUrl` property in the `configurableTabs` array in your app manifest.

You can have multiple channels or group tabs, and up to sixteen personal tabs per app.

## Mobile clients

If you choose to have your channel or group tab appear on Teams mobile clients, the `setSettings()` configuration must have a value for the `websiteUrl` property. To ensure optimal user experience, you must follow the [guidance for tabs on mobile](~/tabs/design/tabs-mobile.md) when creating your tabs. 
Apps that are [distributed through Appsource](~/concepts/deploy-and-publish/appsource/publish.md) have a separate approval process for mobile clients. The default behavior of such apps is as follows:

| **Tab Type** | **Behavior of App if it is optimized for mobile clients** | **Behavior of App if it is not optimized for mobile clients** |
|:-----|:-----|:-----|
| **Static Tabs** or **Personal Tabs**|App appears in the bottom bar of the mobile clients. The tabs open in an in-app webview within the Teams client. | App does not show up in mobile clients. |
| **Configurable Tabs** | The tabs open in an in-app webview within the Teams client using the `contentUrl`. | Selecting **Tab** opens the content using the `websiteUrl` in the default web browser on the device. |


> [!NOTE]
>
> * [Apps submitted to the AppSource for publishing on Teams ](../concepts/deploy-and-publish/overview.md#publish-to-appsource) are evaluated automatically for mobile responsiveness. For any queries, reach out to teamsubm@microsoft.com.
> * For all [apps that are not distributed through the AppSource](../concepts/deploy-and-publish/overview.md), the tabs open in an in-app webview within the Teams clients by default and there is no separate approval process required.
