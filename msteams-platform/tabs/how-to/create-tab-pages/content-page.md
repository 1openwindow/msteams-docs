# Create a content page for your tab

A custom tab allows you to enrich user experience by presenting your hosted web content within the Teams platform in an easily accessible format. Whether you present your tab within the personal or channel/group scope, it is essentially an HTML pageâ€”the difference is how your tab content URL is determined. See [What are custom tabs?](foo.md).

## Tab content and style guidelines

Your tab's overall objective should be to provide access to meaningful and engaging content that has a practical value and an evident purpose. That does not mean that you should forego a pleasing style but, you should focus on minimizing clutter by making your tab design clean, navigation intuitive, and content immersive. See [Content and conversations, all at once using tabs](~/resources/design/framework/tabs) and [Microsoft Teams app approval process guidance](~/platform/publishing/office-store-approval#tabs)

## Integrate your code with Teams

For your tab to display in Teams, you must include the **Microsoft Teams JavaScript client SDK** and include a call to `microsoftTeams.initialize()` after your page loads. That is how your tab and the Teams client communicate:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
...
    <script src= 'https://statics.teams.microsoft.com/sdk/v1.4.3/js/MicrosoftTeams.min.js'></script>
...
</head>

<body>
...
    <script>
    microsoftTeams.initialize();
    </script>
...
</body>
```

>[!IMPORTANT]
>Don't copy/paste the `<script src="...">` URLs from this page, as it might not represent the latest version. To get the latest version of the SDK markup, always go to:
[Microsoft Teams JavaScript API (via CDN)](foo.com).

## Accessing additional content

### Using the SDK to interact with Teams

The **Teams JavaScript client SDK**  and **Teams JavaScript Library* are part of the [Microsoft Teams developer platform](https://msdn.microsoft.com/microsoft-teams) and provide tools and processes to facilitate Teams application creation. The Teams client SDK is distributed as an npm package and the latest version can be found here:
<https://www.npmjs.com/package/@microsoft/teams-js>. The source code for the SDK is located at <https://github.com/OfficeDev/microsoft-teams-library-js> and the library reference table is located at <https://foo.md>.

### Deep links

You can create deep links to entities in Teams. Typically, these are used to create links that navigate to content and information within your tab. See [Create deep links to content and features in Microsoft Teams](foo.md)

### Task Modules

A task module is a modal popup-like experience that you can trigger from your tab. Typically in a content page you do not want to navigate your user through multiple pages. Instead, you will use task modules to present forms for gathering additional information, displaying the details of an item in a list, or any other time you need to present the user with additional information. The task modules themselves can be additional content pages, or created completely using Adaptive Cards. See [Using task modules in tabs](foo.md) for complete information.

### Valid Domains

Ensure that the all URL domains used in your tabs are included in the `validDomains` array in your [manifest](~/concepts/apps/apps-package). For more information, see [validDomains](~/resources/schema/manifest-schema#validdomains) in the manifest schema reference. However, be mindful that the core functionality of your tab exists within Teams and not outside of Teams.
