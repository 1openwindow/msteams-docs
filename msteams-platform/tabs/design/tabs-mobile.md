# Tabs on mobile

> [!NOTE]
> If you choose to have your channel/group tab appear on Teams mobile clients, the `setSettings()` configuration must have a value for the `websiteUrl` property (see below).

Custom tabs can be part of a channel, group chat, or personal app (apps that contain static tabs and/or a one-to-one bot).

Personal apps are available on mobile clients in the app drawer. The app can only be installed from a desktop or web client, and can take up to 24 hours to appear on mobile clients.

Channel tabs are also available on mobile. The default behavior is currently to use your `websiteUrl` to launch your tab in a browser window. However, they can be loaded on a mobile client by clicking the `...` overflow menu next to the tab and choosing **Open**, which will use your `contentUrl` to load the tab inside the Teams mobile client.

## Accessing personal tabs

The following illustration shows how you access a personal tab on mobile.

## Design considerations

Our mobile platform allows apps to be an immersive experience with the app content taking up all of the screen apart from main Teams navigation. To create an immersive experience that fits with Teams, follow these guidelines.

### Responsive design

Because your tab can be opened on devices with a wide range of screen sizes, it needs to follow [responsive design](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_responsive.asp) principles. All of the key constructs should be accessible on mobile devices, and the views should not be distorted. Ensure that when your tab is loaded on a mobile device, all buttons and links are easily accessible using finger-based navigation.

### Layouts

Choosing the correct layout for your tab is important. You should consider the kind of information you're presenting, and choose a layout that organizes it for easy consumption. Some potential options are outlined below.

#### Single canvas

This is one large area where work gets done. The Teams Wiki app follows this pattern. If you have an app that doesn’t separate content into smaller components this would be a good fit.

#### List

Lists are great for sorting and filtering large quantities of data and are great at keeping the most important things at the top. It is helpful to use sortable columns. Actions can be added to each list item under the ellipsis menu.

#### Grid

Grids are useful for showing elements which are highly visual. It helps to include a filter or search control at the top.

### Tabs with bots on mobile

The following example is a personal app that has tabs and a bot.

## UI components

### Color palettes

Using our approved neutral palette for backgrounds, notifications, text, and buttons will help your app feel more at home in Teams. Since Teams mobile has two colour themes (light and dark), it’s a good idea to make sure your app looks great in both.

#### Light color

#### Dark color

### Buttons and controls

The way buttons are styled helps communicate what kind of action they trigger. We maintain a wide range of buttons that are formatted to show different levels of emphasis. Buttons can have text, an icon, or a combination of text and an icon. To communicate different levels in a hierarchy, we designed primary and secondary buttons within each category.

#### Selection controls

Radio buttons, checkboxes, and toggles.

#### Chiclets and pills

### Typography

Typography should be clear and purposeful. Emphasize important information and avoid using multiple fonts and sizes to reduce confusion. We recommend using sentence case and avoiding the usage of all caps for localization and legibility.

### Fields and flyouts

Fields are areas where users can input text. Flyouts are more lightweight than dialogs and appear from the top pane.

## Developer considerations

When you're building an app that includes a tab, you need to consider (and test) how your tab will function on both the Android and iOS Microsoft Teams clients. The sections below outline some of the key scenarios you need to consider.

### Testing on mobile clients

You need to validate that your tab functions properly on mobile devices of various sizes and qualities. For Android devices, you can use the [DevTools](~/tabs/how-to/developer-tools.md) to debug your tab while it is running. We recommend that you test on both high and low performing devices, as well as on a tablet.

### Authentication

For authentication to work on mobile clients, you must upgrade you Teams JavaScript SDK to at least version 1.4.1.

### Low bandwidth and intermittent connections

Mobile clients regularly need to function with low bandwidth and intermittent connections. Your app should handle any timeouts appropriately by providing a contextual message to the user. You should also user progress indicators to provide feedback to your users for any long-running processes.
