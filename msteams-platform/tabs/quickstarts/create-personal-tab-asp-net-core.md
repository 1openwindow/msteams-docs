# Quickstart: Create a custom personal tab with C# and ASP.NET Core in Visual Studio

Custom tabs enable you to embed your hosted web content directly into Microsoft Teams and add Teams-specific functionality via your [Teams App Package](foo.md). See [What are custom tabs in Microsoft Teams?](/msteams-platform/tabs/what-are-custom-tabs.md). There are two types of tabs available in Teams - channel/group and personal. A channel/group tab delivers content to channels and group chats, and personal tabs, along with direct conversation bots, are part of personal apps and are scoped to a single user. Personal tabs can be pinned to the left navigation bar and promote increased productivity by making your service available directly inside the Teams client. 
Your app can have up to sixteen (16) personal tabs

In this quickstart we'll walk-through creating a custom personal tab using the [Microsoft Teams App Project Generator](/OfficeDev/generator-teams). To learn more, see the Microsoft Teams App [Project Structure](/OfficeDev/generator-teams/wiki/Project-Structure) documentation.

## Prerequisites

## Upload and run your app in Microsoft Teams
