# Personal tab with Node.js and Yeoman generator

This quickstart takes you through the steps to create a custom personal tab using Node.js and the Teams Yeoman generator.

A Yeoman Generator for Microsoft Teams Apps projects is the most comprehensive and complete development toolkit for Microsoft Teams development. This generator is targeted to developers who prefer to use TypeScript, React and Node.js as their primary technologies.

## What you'll learn

- It also guides you on how to establish a secure tunnel using ngrok and to upload the application to Teams. 

[!INCLUDE [node-js-yeoman-prereq](~/includes/tabs/node-js-yeoman-prereq.md)]

>[!IMPORTANT]
>The path component *yourDefaultTabNameTab* referenced in this quickstart is the value that you entered in the generator for *Default Tab Name* plus the word *Tab*.
>
>For example: DefaultTabName: *MyTab* => */MyTabTab/*

## Create your personal tab

To add a personal tab to this application, you must create a content page and update existing files:

1. Open code editor, create a new HTML file, **personal.html** and add the following markup:

    ```html
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
        <head>
            <meta charset="UTF-8">
            <title>
                <!-- Todo: add your a title here -->
            </title>
            <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
            <!-- inject:css -->
            <!-- endinject -->
        </head>
            <body>
                <h1>Personal Tab</h1>
                <p><img src="/assets/icon.png"></p>
                <p>This is your personal tab!</p>
            </body>
    </html>
    ```

1. Save **personal.html** in your application's **web** folder:

    ```bash
    ./src/app/web/<yourDefaultTabNameTab>/personal.html
    ```

1. Open **manifest.json** in your code editor:

    ```bash
    ./src/manifest/manifest.json/
   ```

1. Add the following to the empty `staticTabs` array (`staticTabs":[]`) and add the following JSON object:

    ```json
    {
        "entityId": "personalTab",
        "name": "Personal Tab",
        "contentUrl": "https://{{HOSTNAME}}/<yourDefaultTabNameTab>/personal.html",
        "websiteUrl": "https://{{HOSTNAME}}",
        "scopes": ["personal"]
    }

    ```

1. Update the `contentUrl` path component `yourDefaultTabNameTab` with your actual tab name.

1. Save the updated **manifest.json**.

1. Your content page must be served in an IFrame. Open **Tab.ts** in your code editor:

     ```bash
    ./src/app/<yourDefaultTabNameTab>/<yourDefaultTabNameTab>.ts
    ```

1. Add the following to the list of IFrame decorators:

    ```typescript
     @PreventIframe("/<yourDefaultAppName>TabNameTab>/personal.html")
    ```

1. Save the updated **Tab.ts** file. Your tab code is complete.

## Build and run your application

Open a command prompt in your project directory to complete the next tasks.

[!INCLUDE [node-js-yeoman-gulp-tasks](~/includes/tabs/node-js-yeoman-gulp-tasks.md)]

To view your personal tab, go to `http://localhost:3007/<yourDefaultAppNameTab>/personal.html`

## Establish a secure tunnel to your tab

Microsoft Teams is an entirely cloud-based product and requires your tab content to be available from the cloud using HTTPS endpoints. Teams does not allow local hosting, you need to either publish your tab to a public URL or use a proxy that exposes your local port to an internet-facing URL.

To test your tab extension, you must use [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/docs) which is built into this application. Ngrok is a reverse proxy software tool that creates a tunnel to your locally running web server's publicly available HTTPS endpoints.

Your server's web endpoints are available during the current session on your local machine. When the machine is shut down or goes to sleep, the service is no longer available.

In your command prompt, exit localhost and enter the following:

```bash
gulp ngrok-serve
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When your tab is uploaded to Microsoft teams through *ngrok* and successfully saved, you can view it in Teams until your tunnel session ends.

## Upload your application to Teams

1. Open the Microsoft Teams client. If you use the [web based version](https://teams.microsoft.com) you can inspect your front-end code using your browser's [developer tools](~/tabs/how-to/developer-tools.md).
1. In the *YourTeams* panel on the left, select the `...` menu next to the team that you are using to test your tab and select **Manage team**.
1. In the main panel select **Apps** from the tab bar and select **Upload a custom app** located in the lower right-hand corner of the page.
1. Open your project directory, browse to the **./package** folder, select the zip folder, right-click, and select **Open**. Your tab is uploaded into Teams.

## View your personal tabs

Select the `...` menu from the left panel of Teams, and select your application from the list.
