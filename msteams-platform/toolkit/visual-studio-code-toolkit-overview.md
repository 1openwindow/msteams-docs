# Teams Toolkit for Visual Studio Code

Teams Toolkit helps developers to create and deploy Teams apps with integrated Identity, access to cloud storage, data from Microsoft Graph, and other services in Azure and Microsoft 365 with a "zero-configuration" approach to the developer experience.

## Add capabilities

Teams Toolkit provides bots, tabs and messaging extensions as capabilities to integrate with the app. The capabilities used to build your Teams app allows you to increase usage scope. To you develop your project, you need to know more about app capabilities. For more information on App capabilities, see [Understand app capabilities](add-capabilities.md).

## Provision in the cloud

Teams Toolkit provides secure environment to place application resources to the cloud, you must have Azure and M365 cloud services to host the applications, Teams Toolkit directly access applications from the cloud. For more information, see [Provision in the cloud](provision-in-the-cloud.md)

## Add cloud resources

Teams Toolkit provides Azure function app as a cloud resource to host app in cloud. After provisioning for resources in cloud, you can add more resources. For more information, see [Add cloud resources](add-cloud-resources.md).

## Deploy to the cloud

Teams Toolkit helps you to deploy your project code to the provisioned cloud resources with a single command. You can deploy or upload the backend and frontend code in your application to the corresponding provisioned cloud resources in Azure. For more information, see [Deploy to the cloud](deploy-to-the-cloud.md).

## Build CI/CD Pipeline for Teams application

Teams Toolkit helps to automate your development workflow when building Teams application. You must have templates in your repository to build pipelines workflows. For more information on templates and building pipelines, see [Build CI/CD pipelines for Teams application](build-pipelines.md).

## Build apps with Teams Toolkit and Visual Studio

The Microsoft Teams Toolkit enables you to create custom Teams apps directly within the Visual Studio integrated development environment (IDE). The Microsoft Teams toolkit guides you through the process and provides everything you need to build, debug, and launch your Teams app. For more information on building app with Teams Toolkit, see [Build apps with the Teams Toolkit and Visual Studio Code](visual-studio-code-overview.md).
