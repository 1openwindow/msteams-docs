# Add Capabilities

As you continue to develop your project, you may need additional app capabilities. You can start with a Tab application and add a bot to your Teams application later or do so vice-versa.

For more information on Teams app capabilities, see [Understand app capabilities](~/concepts/capabilities-overview.md#app-capabilities).

## Prerequisite

You need to start with a Teams application with one app capability created by the Teams Toolkit V2. 

## What capabilities you can add to your project

Currently there are the following limitations with TeamsFx when adding additional capabilities:
* You cannot add each project capabilities more than once.
* You cannot add any capability if you start with a Tab application with SPFx.
* You cannot add additional Bot capability if your project contains a Messaging Extension.
* You cannot add additional Messaging Extension if your project contains a Bot.

> [!NOTE]
> If you want to include both Bot and Messaging Extension capability, you need to include them at the same time, either when you create a new project or add them together to a Tab application.

**Support Matrix:**

|Current Project Capabilities|	Additional capabilities you can add|
|--------------------|--------------------|
|Tab With SPFx|	No additional capability can be added.|
|Tab with Azure|	Bot, Messaging Extension.|
|Bot|	Tab|
|Messaging Extension|	Tab|
|Tab and Bot|	No additional capability can be added.|
|Tab and Messaging Extension|	No additional capability can be added.|
|Tab, Bot and Messaging Extension|	No additional capability can be added.|

## How to add capabilities

There are several approaches where you can add additional capabilities to your project.

### Add capabilities from Teams Toolkit in Visual Studio Code

1. Activate Teams Toolkit from left side.

    ![Activate Teams Toolkit](~/assets/images/tools-and-sdks/teams-toolkit.png)
  
1. In the Teams Toolkit side bar panel, select `Add capabilities`.

    ![Add capabilities](~/assets/images/tools-and-sdks/add-capabilities.png)
 
1. From the pop up, select the capabilities you want to include into your project.

    ![Select capabilities](~/assets/images/tools-and-sdks/select-capabilities.png)
 
1. Select **OK** to continue, there may be additional questions needed based on the capabilities you selected. Read more these on create project section. (links to create project)

    Alternatively, you can open the command palette and enter **Teams: Add Capabilities**. Follow the same process as itâ€™s triggered from Tree View.

    ![Alternate add capabilities](~/assets/images/tools-and-sdks/alternate-capabilities.png)
  
 
### Add capabilities from TeamsFx CLI in Command Window

1. Change directory to your project directory.
1. Execute following command to add different capabilities:

|Capability and Scenario|	Command|
|-----------------------|----------|
|To Add a Tab	|`teamsfx capability add tab`|
|To Add a Bot With New Bot Registration	|`teamsfx capability add bot --way-to-register-bot create-new`|
|To Add a Bot With Existing Bot Registration|	`teamsfx capability add bot --way-to-register-bot reuse-existing --bot-id your-bot-id --bot-password your-bot-password`|
|To Add a Messaging Extension With New Bot Registration	|`teamsfx capability add messaging-extension --way-to-register-bot create-new`|
|To Add a Messaging Extension With Existing Bot Registration|	`teamsfx capability add messaging-extension --way-to-register-bot reuse-existing --bot-id your-bot-id --bot-password your-bot-password`|

## What will happen after you add additional capabilities

After you successfully added capabilities, and based on the capabilities you selected, these are the changes made to your project and why they are made.

|Capability Added	|What changed|	Why these changes are made|
|-------------------|---------------|-------------------------|
|Bot and Messaging Extension|	A bot template code are added into a subfolder with path `yourProjectFolder/bot` </br></br> `launch.json` and `task.json` updated under `.vscode` folder. </br> </br> `manifest.source.json` file under `appPackage` folder.</br></br> `env.default.json` and `settings.json` under `.fx` folder.|	To include a hello world bot application template into your project. </br><br/>To include necessary scripts for Visual Studio Code  that will be executed when you wish to debug your application locally.</br><br/> Learn more about this in local debug section. (Link to local debug document)</br><br/> To include bot related information in the manifest file that represents your application in the Teams Platform. This change includes: </br> The ID of your bot. </br> The scopes of you bot. </br> The commands that this hello world bot application can respond to. </br><br/>Learn more about what these fields mean in the [Teams Manifest Schema](~/resources/schema/manifest-schema.md).</br></br> To include configurations for TeamsFx to track what capabilities are present in your project so you can easily move your project to cloud. |
|Tab| A frontend tab template code are added into a subfolder with path `yourProjectFolder/tabs`. </br></br>`launch.json` and `task.json` updated under `.vscode` folder. </br></br> `manifest.source.json` file under `appPackage` folder.</br></br> `env.default.json` and `settings.json` under `.fx` folder.|To include a hello world tab application template into your project.</br></br> To include necessary scripts for Visual Studio Code that will be executed when you wish to debug your application locally.</br></br> Learn more about this in local debug section. (Link to local debug document)</br></br> To include tab related information in the manifest file that represents your application in the Teams Platform.
