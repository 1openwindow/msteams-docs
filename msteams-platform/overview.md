# What are Microsoft Teams apps?

Microsoft Teams is a chat-based workspace in Office 365 that integrates with the apps and services that people use to get work done together. The Microsoft Teams developer platform makes it easy for developers to integrate their own apps and services within Teams to add value, improve productivity, make decisions faster, provide focus (by reducing context switching), and create collaboration around existing content and workflows.
