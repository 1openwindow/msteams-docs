# What are Microsoft Teams apps?

Microsoft Teams is a collaboration workspace in Office 365 that integrates with apps and services people use to get work done together. The Microsoft Teams developer platform makes it easy for developers to integrate their own apps and services to improve productivity, make decisions faster, provide focus (by reducing context switching), and create collaboration around existing content and workflows. Apps built on the Microsoft Teams platform are bridges between the Teams client and your services and workflows; bringing them directly into the context of your collaboration platform.

A Teams app consists of three major pieces:

* **The Microsoft Teams client (web, desktop or mobile)** where users will interact with your app.
* **Your Teams app package** that creates the app installed by your users, and contains your app's metadata.
* **Your service, workflow or website** which perform the necessary logic, data storage and API calls to power your app.
